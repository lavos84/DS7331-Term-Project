We will be able to mine interesting and current statistics such as percentage of land and structure use in Manhattan and get  visuals of these percentages by borough or for the city as a whole.  Also of interest is to find comparison rates of residential use vs. commercial, recreational, and educational usage.\n",

At a glance, we would also like to see if we can accurately predict the assessed land value based on a number of other features.  Another area we'd like to explore is to see if we can correctly label what a given structure's primary use is for and compare our algorithm to the known labeles in the \"Current Uses\" field."

Out of the 55,951 records, only one value is missing in the \"Assess Land\" feature;  The record with a missing value is \"The Arsenal\", a landmark, with no commercial value, hence this is a non-issue. https://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/the-arsenal.  Similarly we found 2,614 records with a 'zero' as the value in the \"Assess Land\" feature, and we can tell that these line items are properties such as parks, rail use, schools, etc. \n",

    "We reviewed each of the 74 features to understand the quality of the data.  A detailed density analysis was executed on features with missing values and we produced a corresponding bar chart of these data. The bar chart proved to be of great value to gain knowledge of the dataset.  We conducted additional research on each of the features with the most missing values (greater than 90% missing) and this allowed us to decide whether the features with missing data would impact our analysis or answering some questions of intere"

The exception to this is district 46 (the large orange district near the bottom of Brooklyn).  According to http://www.ny4p.org/client-uploads/pdf/District-Profiles/NY4P_CCDP_2015_46.pdf, this district is primarily composed of playgrounds, which may justify why the total assessed land value is high compared to the relatively few historical landmarks located there."

Although it is tempting to suggest that every value in this column that isn't \"Yes\" must be \"No,\" that just simply isn't the case.  A property could have an open petroleum spill and there is just no data on it yet.  It is impossible to distinguish \"No's\" from nulls.\n",

To do this, we will change the data type of the \"Date Created\" field from a string to a datetime format.

When we set the max iterations to 10,000 however, this is not the case.\n",

We see that the highest number of correct predictions were the multi-family elevator buildings even though it incorrectly predicted vacant lots, parking structues, and open space as this class well.  The LR model on the other hand incorrectly predicted that those multi-family elevator buildings were vacant lots or open spaces.
